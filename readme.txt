Hi! Welcome to my 15-112 Term Project: PyGame Mini

This is a small computer modeling program, where you can draw anything you like, and make it into 3D, without using any existing 3D Python modules.

To get started, make sure you have python 3 installed on your device.
If you do not, follow this link to download: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Next, make sure you have some sort of program that can run .py files.
If you do not, some great examples are Pyzo and Sublime Text.

Lastly, if you do not already have it, install the python module pygame using the pip install built into python.
Additional instuctions for how to install pygame on different devices can be found here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
If you are having trouble installing pygame, go to the 15-112 website and find the module manager, made by the class's awesome T.A.


Now you are ready to run PyCAD Mini!

Open up the file titled "__init__" and run it. A separate window should pop up with the PyCAD Mini main menu.
That's all you need to get started!

Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoy the program.
